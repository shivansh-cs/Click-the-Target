This project features a lightweight browser-based game called Click the Target, created using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed as a beginner-friendly demonstration of interactive web development without external libraries or frameworks. The gameplay is simple: a red box appears inside a defined game area and automatically changes its position every two seconds. The user must click the box before it moves, testing reflexes, accuracy, and response time. All game logic, styling, and structure are contained within a single index.html file, making it easy to understand, modify, and expand. This project is ideal for learning event handling, DOM updates, and basic game loops.
